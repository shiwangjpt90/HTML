There are three code files in this: index.html, index1.html, and project.html. From these two files index.html and index1.html, I created a project that is called project.html. In project.html, I used all the major HTML tags, and it includes a form and my portfolio. In index.html and index1.html, I practiced using all the tags before applying them to my project. This concludes the fundamental explanation of my project.
